## General notes
This patch works much like a video game and anyone with some gaming experience should be able to intuitively grasp the motion of the game.



LEFT STICK: navigate. use the pictslider as a reference.

RIGHT STICK: control pitch/tempo of mc.saw. 



TRIANGLE: trigger bell sound.

SQUARE: toggle mc.saw. note that it is only audible closs the to "PLAYERS" and not the "STREET".

CROSS: init. sequence.

CIRCLE: change sequence. There are 3 sequences.


LEFT TRIGGER: change mc.saw articulation.

RIGHT TRIGGER: change navigation speed. similar to a "sprint" button in video games.
